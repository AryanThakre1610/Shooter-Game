# Canvas Shooter Game

A simple 2D shooter game built using the HTML5 Canvas API. The player controls a character, shoots enemies, and tracks score and health. The project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts in JavaScript, including data structures, algorithms, and asynchronous asset loading.
